(11) Introduction
Welcome to the Bladerunner Shot Viewer! Here you will be able to view each shot from the video above. In this scene K, our replicant bladerunner protagonist, visits Dr. Ana Stelline to figure out whether a memory that he has is real or not. The acne is interesting in that the 
Right from the beginning we know that this part of the film is different then the rest. Shot 1 starts with a long shot of vibrant forest, in direct contrast with the unnatural, muted, busy streets of Los Angelos. From our previous knowledge we know that this setting is impossible. The environment of this world collapsed, leaving only protein worm farms to prop up the decaying human race. The sun creates nautral light through the canopy, diffusing off of leaves and creating low key lighting. This gives a much more “genuine” or “natural” appearance to the mise-en-scene. Successive cuts shortens the shot distance distance, pulling the audience’s attention to a small beatle perched ontop of a leaf. During Shot 4, the beatle sits in the center of the frame, in addition to the shallow depth of field blurring the background. We see the bug mutate, growing new antenna followed by a flash and a technological sound. At Shot 5, we see our first peice of technology in this scene, a metal rotary device. In an interview, Dennis Villeneuve said he wanted something tangible and mechanical to control the holograms in this scene. This allowed Carla Juri, Dr. Ana Stelline’s actor, to better interact with the environment and the prop. Throughout the scene, the camera slightly mimics Dr. Stellines focus. The extreme close ups show us that Dr. Stelline is focusing on a small object, such as a bug. What really stands out in this scene is the subtle rule of thirds. In Shot 7, we overlook a clearing surrounded by dark banches. A bright spot of light lays right bellow Dr. Ana Stelline, drawing our eyes closer to her. In that same shot floats a blue holographic display in Dr. Stelline’s line of sight. This reminds the viewer that this is infact a holograph and not real life. Her work is interrupted by K, whose entrance is marked with a resounding alert. The natural forrest blinks away leaving an austere room. Shot 10, the reverse of the previous shot, uses a mobile camera to track Dr. Stelline’s movements to the visitor area. Surprisingly, this is the only time the camera is mobile in this entire scene.


(21) Reflections
Once the forrest flickers away, the room that is left is barren and sterile. The space appears to be a concrete dome with arces etched into the surface. A long white light casts light up unto the walls. Shot 17, gives us an exellent long shot from the back of the room into the visitor area. We see a liberally applied rule of thirds, with a futon bed and storage/medical equipment. Practically the room makes sense: any florishings can influence the way Dr. Stelline makes her memories. The white setting and costume serve both as in a practical sense but also to show how isolated Dr. Stelline is from the outside world. The room is clean, unlike the streets outside. Color theory is used to show the difference between the two characters. Dr. Stelline lives in this gray white world wearing white clothes while K comes from a darker more sinister world wearing darker clothes. The physical set piece that separates the two is a window, which I think is a fantastic way to convey this idea. Their two worlds are like water and oil, they cannot mix but only view at each other.
	Another dichotomic element is size. Whenever Dr. Stelline is shown in this section, it is always at a higher angle which positions her closer to the corner of the frame. K in contrast usually sits in the middle of the frame at all times. At all times is not figurative, as the frame cleverly uses the reflection of the window to show both of them at the same time. Whenever one of the characters is speaking, the other can be seen reacting from the reflection. The positioning of the reflections serve as inference for the later information in the film. Dr. Stelline or her light counterpart, are always within the domain of K’s respective counterpart. This hints at how Dr. Stelline’s memory is the memory K is trying to search for but it could also yet again place Dr. Stelline as smaller then K.

Dr. Stelline leaves the encounter and does some work. Yet another practical light hangs from the ceiling of the visiting room, which explains the 3-point lighting preset throughout the last section
