Welcome to the Bladerunner Shot Viewer! Here you will be able to view each shot from the video above. In this scene K, our replicant bladerunner protagonist, visits Dr. Ana Stelline to figure out whether a memory that he has is real or not. The acne is interesting in that the 
Right from the beginning we know that this part of the film is different then the rest. Shot 1 starts with a long shot of vibrant forest, in direct contrast with the unnatural, muted, busy streets of Los Angelos. From our previous knowledge we know that this setting is impossible. The environment of this world collapsed, leaving only protein worm farms to prop up the decaying human race. The sun creates nautral light through the canopy, diffusing off of leaves and creating low key lighting. This gives a much more “genuine” or “natural” appearance to the mise-en-scene. Successive cuts shortens the shot distance distance, pulling the audience’s attention to a small beatle perched ontop of a leaf. During Shot 4, the beatle sits in the center of the frame, in addition to the shallow depth of field blurring the background. We see the bug mutate, growing new antenna followed by a flash and a technological sound. At Shot 5, we see our first peice of technology in this scene, a metal rotary device. In an interview, Dennis Villeneuve said he wanted something tangible and mechanical to control the holograms in this scene. This allowed Carla Juri, Dr. Ana Stelline’s actor, to better interact with the environment and the prop.
